## Prototype Design Pattern
The Prototype design pattern is a creational design pattern that allows creating new objects by copying existing objects, known as prototypes, without the need to know their specific class or details of their construction. This pattern is used when the creation of an object is complex or expensive and can be used to clone objects with different configurations without having to create each object from scratch.

The Prototype pattern consists of a Prototype interface or abstract class that declares the methods for cloning itself and a Concrete Prototype that implements the Clone method. The Client code then creates a new object by calling the Clone method of the existing object.

One of the advantages of using the Prototype pattern is that it can help reduce the number of subclasses that are needed in an application. Instead of creating new subclasses for each configuration of an object, the prototype pattern allows the creation of new objects by copying the prototypes.

The Prototype pattern can also help reduce the complexity of creating new objects in an application by delegating the cloning process to the prototype itself. This can help simplify the Client code and make it easier to add new types of objects to an application.

### Usecases
1. **Dynamic object creation**: In some situations, it may be necessary to create objects dynamically during runtime based on user input or other dynamic factors. In such cases, the Prototype pattern can be used to create new objects without knowing their exact class.

2. **Large object creation**: When creating a large object that requires a lot of time and resources, it can be more efficient to clone an existing object and modify it as needed rather than creating a new one from scratch.

3. **Object initialization customization**: Sometimes, objects may require different initialization procedures depending on their intended use. The Prototype pattern can be used to create customized objects with different initialization procedures based on their intended use.

4. **Immutable objects**: In situations where you need to create immutable objects, the Prototype pattern can be used to create copies of the original object that cannot be modified directly.
