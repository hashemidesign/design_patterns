## Facade Design Pattern
----
The Facade design pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, making it easier to use and understand. The pattern is used to hide the complexity of a system and present a simpler interface to clients.

The Facade pattern involves creating a single class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem. This class acts as a mediator between the client and the subsystem, shielding the client from the complexity of the system.

Here are some pros and cons of using the Facade pattern:

### Pros:
- Simplifies the interface to a complex system, making it easier to use and understand
- Reduces coupling between the client and the subsystem, making it easier to modify or replace individual components
- Improves maintainability by providing a single point of entry for the client

### Cons:
- Can lead to a large facade class that tries to do too much
- Can make it difficult to access low-level functionality of the subsystem
- May hide too much of the underlying system, making it difficult to diagnose problems

The Facade pattern can be used in many situations, such as:
- Providing a simpler interface to a complex library or API
- Simplifying interactions with a complex hardware or software system
- Improving the organization and maintainability of a large, complex codebase

Overall, the Facade pattern is a powerful tool for simplifying the interface to a complex system, but should be used judiciously to avoid hiding too much of the underlying system or creating a facade class that is too large and difficult to maintain.
