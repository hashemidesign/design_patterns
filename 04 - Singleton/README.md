# Singleton Design Pattern
The Singleton design pattern is a creational pattern that ensures that only one instance of a class can be created and provides a global point of access to that instance. This means that once the object is created, all further requests for that object return the same instance.

Singletons are useful when we need to limit the number of instances of an object in our application, to avoid the unnecessary duplication of resources or to ensure that there is only one point of control. Common examples of the Singleton pattern in use include database connections, logging services, and configuration managers.

In general, the Singleton pattern involves defining a class that has a private constructor to prevent its instantiation, and a static method to provide a single point of access to the unique instance. The instance is usually created lazily, i.e., only when it is requested for the first time. Once created, subsequent requests for the instance will return the same instance.

  
# Why singleton is not a good approach
While the Singleton pattern can be useful in some specific situations, it is not always the best approach to use. Here are some reasons why:

1. **Global State**: The Singleton pattern creates a global state in the application, making it more difficult to test, reason about and maintain the code.

2. **Difficult to mock**: Due to the global nature of the Singleton pattern, it is difficult to replace the Singleton instance with a mock instance during testing.

3. **Concurrency**: The Singleton pattern can be problematic in concurrent systems, where multiple threads or processes can access the same Singleton instance simultaneously, causing race conditions and unpredictable behavior.

4. **Hard to extend**: The Singleton pattern is often implemented using a static method, which makes it hard to extend or substitute the behavior of the Singleton instance.

5. **Hidden dependencies**: The Singleton pattern hides its dependencies and makes them implicit, which can make the code harder to understand and maintain.

6. **Violates the Single Responsibility Principle**: The Singleton pattern violates the Single Responsibility Principle, which states that a class should have only one reason to change. The Singleton pattern takes on both the responsibility of creating an object and ensuring that only one instance is created.

Therefore, while the Singleton pattern can be useful in some specific situations, it is important to consider its drawbacks and alternatives before using it.
