# Adapter Design Pattern
Adapter design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It converts the interface of one class into an interface that matches the expectations of the client, making it possible for objects with different interfaces to work together.

The adapter pattern is used when an existing class's interface does not meet the needs of a new client. It is a solution for bridging the gap between two incompatible interfaces. It allows you to reuse existing code without changing it.

The adapter pattern should not be used if there is no need to work with objects with incompatible interfaces. It should also not be used to add new functionality to an existing class. In that case, the decorator pattern may be more appropriate.
