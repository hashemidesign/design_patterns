## Builder Design Pattern
-----
The builder design pattern is used when you need to create complex objects that require multiple steps and configurations to be built. It provides a flexible solution to create objects with different configurations without needing to define multiple constructors with different parameter combinations.

You should consider using the builder design pattern in the following situations:

1. When you need to create objects that have multiple parts or configurations.
2. When there are many optional parameters to be set during the object creation, and defining a constructor with all possible parameter combinations would be impractical.
3. When you need to create immutable objects, i.e., objects whose state cannot be changed once they are created.
4. When you want to hide the complexity of object creation from the client code, and provide a simplified API for creating the objects.

Overall, the builder pattern provides a convenient way to create complex objects, and allows for more readable and maintainable code by separating the construction process from the rest of the code.
