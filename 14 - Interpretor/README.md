## Interpretor Design Pattern
----
The Interpreter pattern is a design pattern used in software development to define a representation of a language and an interpreter that processes it. It is often used to build domain-specific languages and can be used to simplify complex expressions.

The Interpreter pattern defines a grammar for the language and provides an interpreter that can evaluate expressions in the language. The interpreter takes the input expression and converts it into a series of instructions that can be executed.

### Pros:
- It provides a way to define domain-specific languages that can simplify complex problems.
- It provides a way to add new expressions to the language without modifying existing code.
- It can improve the efficiency of processing complex expressions by reducing the number of operations required.

### Cons:
- It can be difficult to design a good grammar for the language.
- It can be difficult to debug errors in the interpreter.


### When to use Interpreter pattern:
- When you need to define a domain-specific language.
- When you need to process complex expressions.
- When you need to add new expressions to a language without modifying existing code.
- When you need to evaluate expressions efficiently.
